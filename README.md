# Learning Go Programming Repository
This repository is dedicated to learning Go programming language by exploring fundamental concepts, problem-solving, and organizing code structures. It contains three main folders:

### Concepts
This folder houses practical implementations and examples of various foundational concepts in Go programming. You'll find demonstrations of loops (e.g., for loops), switch statements, different types of data structures (e.g., arrays, slices, maps), and more. These implementations serve as helpful references for understanding how these concepts work in Go.

### Problems
In this section, you'll find a collection of example problems designed to challenge and enhance your Go programming skills. These problems cover a range of difficulty levels and diverse topics, allowing you to practice and reinforce your understanding of Go's syntax, logic, and problem-solving capabilities.

### Structures
The Structures directory demonstrates different approaches to organizing Go files. It showcases four distinct methods of structuring .go files within a project. Understanding these structures can greatly aid in maintaining a clean, scalable, and readable codebase.
