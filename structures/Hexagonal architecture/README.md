# Hexagonal architecture

We arrive at one of the well-known ways of grouping functionality together - Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports & Adapters or the onion architecture. ðŸ™‚

This is my favourite way of structuring Go apps, especially when coupled with a microservice architecture.
I find that it scales well to problems of different sizes and complexity, and you can add or remove as many layers as you need:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ dao
â”œâ”€â”€ domain
â””â”€â”€ handler
```

You can also combine many smaller hex structures to form your entire program:

(imagine an app which compiles a restaurant menu by pulling information from three completely different sources)

```
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ beer
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ dao
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ domain
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ handler
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ service.go
â”œâ”€â”€ wine
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ dao
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ domain
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ handler
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ service.go
â””â”€â”€ food
  â”œâ”€â”€ dao
  â”œâ”€â”€ domain
  â”œâ”€â”€ handler
  â””â”€â”€ service.go
```

This structure is great for:
- complex projects which require a well-defined structure to stay maintainable and understandable
- applications which have dependencies such as databases, user interfaces or third party APIs
