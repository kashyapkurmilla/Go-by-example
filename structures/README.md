# Go Program Structures
### Single File Structure
In simpler cases, a Go program might exist in a single file named main.go. This file typically contains the main() function, serving as the entry point of the program. It's a straightforward approach for small projects.

### Multi-File Structure
For larger projects, breaking down code into multiple files is necessary. This segregation helps in managing various functionalities like handling API endpoints, managing databases, or implementing specific operations. Grouping related code into separate files within appropriate directories helps maintain clarity and organization.

### Packages
Go code is organized into packages, acting as containers for related code. A package starts with a package declaration and includes functions, types, and variables related to a specific aspect of the program. This structuring aids in encapsulation, reusability, and maintaining clear boundaries between different parts of the codebase.

### Hexagonal Architecture
Hexagonal architecture, also known as ports and adapters architecture, emphasizes a clear separation between the core business logic (domain) and external components (like databases, UI, etc.). In Go, this separation can be achieved using interfaces. The domain logic resides in one package, while the implementation details for external components reside in another package. This separation ensures that the core logic isn't tightly coupled to specific implementations, enabling easier testing, maintenance, and future changes.

Overall, structuring Go files thoughtfully by organizing code into logical units (packages), separating concerns, and implementing design patterns like hexagonal architecture helps create maintainable, scalable, and modular applications.
